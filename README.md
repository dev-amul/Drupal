# Drupal - Content Management Platform

# Overview

Drupal is a free and open-source content management platform that
supports a wide range of websites from personal blogs to
enterprise-level and community-driven portals. It is highly flexible,
extensible, and maintained by a large community of developers and users.
Drupal is well-suited for websites that require complex data
organization, user role management, and dynamic content presentation.



# Architecture

Drupal is built on a modular architecture that allows developers to
easily extend functionality using modules and themes. Key architectural
components include:

* Core system which provides the base functionality 
*  Modules that add specific features like search, user management, and content types
* Themes that control the visual appearance of the site 
*  Hooks and APIs for developers to interact with and customize the platform 
* Installation profiles that define how Drupal is configured during
  installation

Drupal promotes a strict separation between logic and presentation using
its theme system and relies on configuration-driven site building.

# Tech Stack

* PHP as the programming language 
*  MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, or SQLite as the database 
*  Apache, Nginx, or other web servers 
*  Twig as the templating engine in modern Drupal versions 
*  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend 
*  YAML and JSON for configuration files
