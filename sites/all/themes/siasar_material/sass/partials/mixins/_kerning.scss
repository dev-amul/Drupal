// Kerning Mixin
//
// The following Mixin makes browsers use font's kerning info.
// While related to tracking ("letter-spacing"), kerning is not the same thing.
// Think of tracking as the general "distance between characters" parameter,
// and kerning as an adjustment applied to tracking on certain character pairs
// that need special consideration.
//
// For example, "MT"
//
// Only OpenType fonts support kerning.
//
// Prefixes are automatically added by SASS compiler for Safari support.

  font-feature-settings: "kern" 1; // Required by IE
  font-kerning: normal;
